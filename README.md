### Acoustic Signal Processing for Bioacoustics

These are a bunch of interactive Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating some fundamental concepts in acoustic signal processing that can be applied in bioacoustics. These notebooks were made for a workshop within the [BioacAI](https://bioacousticai.eu) project.
