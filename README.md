### Acoustic Signal Processing for Bioacoustics

These are a bunch of interactive Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating some fundamental concepts in acoustic signal processing that can be applied in bioacoustics. These notebooks were made for a workshop within the [BioacAI](https://bioacousticai.eu) project. 

It's recommended to use a virtual environment and install the python packages in the requirements.txt file before running the notebooks. These notebooks were built with Python version 3.10.12, and should work on future versions, but that has not been extensively tested.
